	<div><font size="5" color="blue">The main area of my study late in and after secondary education is the study of programming computers. My skills primarily consist of computer applications and applications and the use and understanding of codding languages of html and java. Along with knowing said languages of code, I also have a willingness to learn new languages for programming computers. One of my other capabilities for computer knowledge is the ability to easily look up and understand the terms and knowledge that I lacked prior to searching them. One of my better areas of understanding for general thought is the ability to use my mind to think of many different solutions to a problem that is at hand and applying the solution reasonably quickly. Finaly, I am fully capable of acting calm during a stressful event.</font></div>
